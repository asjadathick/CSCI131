<a name='julius'><h1>PDP-11</h1>
<p>The simulator is implemented in Javascript; it models a PDP-11/40
computer with a disk, teletype, and clock.</p>
<p>The simulator itself was written by 
<a href='http://www.aiju.de/about_me/'><em>Julius Schmidt</em></a>
who wanted to run 1976 Unix V6.  You can run Unix V6 on his machine at his
site <a href='http://pdp11.aiju.de'>pdp11.aiju.de</a>. That version of the code
downloads an image of Unix V6 copying it to the emulated disk 
(i.e. a big Javascript int[]), and
then starting it.  If you have a good machine, and you are
running a decent Javascript (such as that in the Chrome browser), his emulated PDP-11
runs Unix at almost the same speed as the original hardware.  (It shows number of instructions
per second, and it's close to 1 million instructions per second.)  Create a file in C,
compile it, run it.  Everything works.  (But it is Unix-V6.  You have to use 'ed' as
your editor.  You can switch a setting and have a full character set, but by
default it is TTY-33 so there are many missing characters - e.g. '{' is /(.  The
C dialect is 1976; more than a little archaic.)</p>
<h2>Running Unix V6 on Julius Schmidt's Javascript PDP-11</h2>

<a name='csci131'><h1>Bare PDP-11</h1>
<p>The exercises for CSCI131 use the bare machine - no operating system.  
The simulator is introduced in the lecture <a href='http://www.uow.edu.au/~nabg/131/04PDP11.pdf'>04PDP11.pdf</a>
It is presented in a <a href='./Page1.html'>HTML page with four tabs</a>.</p>

<li><a href='#dump'>Dump memory</a></li>
</ul>
<img src='./images/doc2.jpg' alt='screenshot of simulator'/>
<a name='assemble'/><h2>Editing and Assembly</h2>
<p>The first tab has a text area where you can enter the assembly language code for
your PDP-11 program.  The code can be typed in directly, or you can load code from
a file on your own computer that you have created using some preferred text editor.</p>
<p>The assembler that has been added to Julius Schmidt's Javascript system is a 
simple absolute assembler.  You specify the locations where your instructions and
data are to be stored.  There is no provision for linking multiple files; a program must
be complete.</p>
<p>The assembly directives that are supported are:</p>
<dl>
<dt>.origin</dt>
<dd>Sets the start address for the next segment of code or data</dd>

<dt>.end</dt>
<dd>Marks the end of the program and identifies a start address.
</dd>

<dt>.string</dt>
<dd>Ascii text that will be terminated by at least one null byte.
</dd>

<dt>.word</dt>
<dd>Comma separated list of word values.
</dd>

<dt>.blkw</dt>
<dd>Reserves a block of memory of specified number of words.
</dd>

<dt>semi-colon</dt>
<dd>A semi-colon character ';' marks the start of a comment.
</dd>

</dl>
<p>All numbers used must be octal (no preceding 0, this isn't C/C++).  The
lecture <a href='http://www.uow.edu.au/~nabg/131/05PDP11Details.pdf'>05PDP11Details.pdf</a>
has an introduction to the instruction set and addressing modes of the PDP-11.
The <a href='./pdp11-40.pdf'>PDP-11-40 Manual</a> has more details of instructions.</p>
<p>On a bare PDP-11, the first 1000octal locations are typically reserved.  The lowest
order addresses are used for interrupt vectors (all explained in the lectures).  The
system stack starts at 776 (octal) and grows down.  So programs will typically have a
start address of 1000.</p>
<h3>First example</h3>
<p>The first example, as in the lecture notes, will be a program that copies a string
and determines the length of the string.  An equivalent C++ program would be something
like the following:</p>
<img src='./images/doc3.jpg'>
<p>(The C++ code has no output.  You would have to run it with the gdb debugger and inspect 
data in memory.  Which is appropriate, because this first PDP-11 assembly language program
doesn't generate any output and results must be viewed via a memory dump.)</p>
<p>The PDP-11 Assembly language code that should be typed into the textarea in the
web-page is:</p>
<pre>
; Program to copy and determine length of string
.origin 1000
start: mov #msga, r1
   mov #msgb, r2
   clr r0
l1: movb (r1)+, (r2)+
   beq done
   inc r0
   br l1
done: halt
msga: .string "A string whose length is to be determined"
msgb: .string "Different string that should get overwritten"
.end start
</pre>
<p>The program uses registers r1 and r2 as pointers; and register r0 will be used
to accumulate a count that will give the length of the copied string.  Registers
r1 and r2 are loaded with the byte addresses of the source string and destination
area. The program loops, copying a byte from the source to the destination.  The
registers are updated after each byte is copied.  The loop terminates when a nul
byte was copied to mark the end of the string; otherwise register r0 is incremented
and the loop repeats.</p>
<p>The code should be copy-pasted into the code area:</p>
<img src='./images/doc4.jpg'>
<p>The HTML button "Assemble" invokes the assembly process.  This program should assemble 
without errors.  The code is automatically loaded into the memory of
the simulated PDP-11.</p>
<a name='Symbols'><h2>Symbol table</h2>
<p>The first pass of the two pass assembly process works out the locations
that will be used for instructions and data elements.  All labels (names of data
elements, labels used on instructions that get referenced in branches and jumps)
are entered into the symbol table.  When running programs, or inspecting memory
dumps, you need to know the address of the data elements that you wish to view.</p>
<p>The generated symbol table can be viewed in the "Symbol Table" tab.</p>
<img src='./images/doc5.jpg'>
<a name='Exec'><h2>Program execution</h2>
<p>The 'Program execution' tab has the controls and displays for program execution.</p>
<img src='./images/doc6.jpg'>
<p>Programs can be executed in single-step mode - one instruction at a time, under
user control (use the "Step" button to execute the next instruction).  Alternatively,
the program can be run in step-step mode; the program runs continuously (it's slowed
down considerably, by delays between each instruction, so that a 
user can observe what is going on).  If it's running in step-step mode, clicking the
"Step" button will put it back in single step mode.</p>
<h4>Controls</h4>
<img src='./images/doc7.jpg'>
<p>The "Restart" button should reset the states of machine and registers to what they
were when the program was just loaded, allowing the execution process to be started
over agin.</p>
<p>As the program executes, the line with the last executed instruction is highlighted
in the "Generated code" text area:</p>
<img src='./images/doc8.jpg'>
<p>If the program is too long to appear in its entirety, the textarea should scroll 
to show the highlighted instruction.</p>
<p>The registers, status flags, and priority settings are updated as each instruction
is executed.</p>
<img src='./images/doc9.jpg'>
<p>The combination of register display and instruction highlighting allow the user
to observe in detail the execution steps.  If a user wants to watch in detail, he/she
uses the single-step "Step" button; but when boredom sets in, the "Step-Step" button
can be used to get the program to run to completion.</p>
<p>Execution terminates when a halt instruction is reached.  (All memory is initialized
to 0; 0 is the op-code for "halt".  So if an erroneous program jumps to some random unused
part of memory it immediately halts.)</p>
<img src='./images/doc10.jpg'>
<p>Program output to the simulated teletype device appears in the text area that is
part of the image of an ASR-33 model teletype.  If a program is to read input, the
mouse must be clicked in this same text area before characters are typed.  (Characters
typed in are not printed automatically; the program must echo characters if display
is needed.)  Input and output are slowed so that wait loops and interrupt
handling can be observed (in Step-Step mode, speed works out as
about twice as fast as the original ASR-33 hardware).</p>
<img src='./images/doc11.jpg'>
<a name='dump'><h2>Dump memory</h2>
<p>The "Dump memory" tab has a control and a text area.  The text area is used
to display memory locations and their contents.  Each line in the memory dump
shows the contents of 8 words (16 bytes) of memory.  The leftmost column shows
the address of the first word of that line.</p>
<p>The "Dump memory" HTML button is used to get the current contents of memory
displayed.</p>
<img src='./images/doc12.jpg'>
<p>The program does not have to terminate before you take a memory dump.  If
you are running in single step mode, you can at any time switch tabs and use the
"Dump memory" button to get the memory displayed.</p>
<a name='programs'><h1>Example programs from lectures</h1>
<p>There are several example PDP-11 programs in the
<a href='http://www.uow.edu.au/~nabg/131/05PDP11Details.pdf'>PDP-11 details lecture</a>.  They
illustrate basic data manipulations, loops, function calls and use of stack,
wait-loop I/O, 'supervisor calls' and interrupt handling.  They build up to a kind
of simplified interrupt driven operating system.</p>
<p>The <a href='http://www.uow.edu.au/~nabg/131/10Compilers.pdf'>Compilers</a> lecture
and associated assessment tasks show how to construct a compiler for a small
subset of Basic (? well, a Basic-like language)
that generates code that can run on the simulated PDP-11 with 
the primitive OS and a systems library (the limited equivalent of Linux's libc).</p>
<p>Some of these programs are included in the download package.</p>

This is the version where interrupts are correctly masked out prior to entry
to a critical region.  (It's a rather complex example, but needed complexity
to illustrate the problem.  The concept of "critical regions" must be
understood by any programmer who intends to implement interrupt driven code.)

</dt>
<dd>Example from 05PDP11Details.pdf, about slide 220, illustrating a simple
non-interrupt driven "operating system". 
<br>The earliest operating systems
incorporated utility functions such as ascii&lt;-&gt;integer conversion
functions as well as more fundamental things like i/o handling. In later
systems, utility functions became part of standard libraries that were
linked with user code. Also, in early operating systems, OS functions
were invoked with simple subroutine calls.  This code mimics such
an early OS.

<dd>Example from 05PDP11Details.pdf, about slide 260, illustrating
"traps" or "supervisor calls".  As operating systems became more 
sophisticated, extra instructions (emt/trap/svc/...) were added
that were to be used in calls to the OS.  This example is the same
as the previous one but using "trap" instructions.
